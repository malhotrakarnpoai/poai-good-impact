            Poai is an Ai Product & Community collective based in Goa. The name 'Poai' is inspired by the Goan bread 'Poe', with a nod to the essential role that bread and Ai play in our lives. Breaking bread over warm conversations is how we want to grow this impact focussed Ai product and community collective.
